# üìö book-tracker

This is a foundational version of a command-line Book Tracker built in Python.  
It helps you manage your reading list; books you've read, are currently reading, or plan to read.

The project is designed with clean object-oriented architecture and is built to be easily extended into a richer interface in the future (e.g. GUI, web, or Streamlit).

## üöÄ Features

- Add new books to your reading list
- Track book status: `to_read`, `reading`, or `read`
- Mark books as finished and rate them (0‚Äì5)
- List all books or filter only finished ones
- Remove books from the list
- Interactive menu system via `main.py`
